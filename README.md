# Hash functions and multiplanes


In this `Notebook`, we will practice the most important concepts related to hash functions.

A key point for the lookup using hash functions is calculating the hash key or bucket ID we assign for a given entry. In this notebook, we will cover:

* Basic hash tables
* Multiplanes
* Random planes
